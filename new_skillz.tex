\chapter{NewSkillz Behaviour Framework}
\label{chap:rl}

\section{Introduction}
The work presented here describes the new behaviours framework for rUNSWift and is the combined effort of the following authors: Beth Crane, Jack Murray, Dan Padilha, Stephen Sherratt, and Alexander Whillas.

The \textit{NewSkillz} behaviour framework is a new implementation of the Python-based control logic for the rUNSWift codebase. The new framework aims to replace the existing Python skills by allowing for a much easier learning curve, easily understandable code, the removal of redundancy through abstraction, and less need for complex state transition models. Furthermore, the framework is abstracted in such a way that allows the same behaviour code to be run on the robots as well as in simulators with no modification required.

As the effort of many authors, information is spread throughout various reports. In particular, more information about the integration with a simulator can be found in the work of Crane and Sherratt.\cite{simulator}
